## Hey, we are bitcrowd! ðŸ‘‹

We're building customized software solutions, small and large, simple and complex, for small companies and big corporations. If you're interested, come visit us at [our homepage](https://bitcrowd.net)!

### Open Source Software

We're standing on the shoulders of giants, as a lot of our software depends on the foundations built by the amazing open source community ðŸ’—. Hence, whenever we have time, we love to give back: By contributing patches to projects of others or by maintaining and improving our own OSS libraries, which you can take a look at here.
